## About
I wanted to write a Python script that could find the best possible answers to the [Immaculate Grid](https://www.immaculategrid.com/) game. Similar to a Sudoku solver, I wrote custom logic to optimize the answers the solver presents. I had to seek out very specific data sources and find work arounds for inconsistent data standards. Currently, the solver is built for team&team questions (i.e. What players played for Seattle and Houston), Cy Young, MVP, Silver Slugger, Gold Glove and Rookie of the Year award winners. The solver has produced the top score and routinely, scores in the top 10 based on rarity of submissions.
